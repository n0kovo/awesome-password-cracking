# Awesome Password Cracking	 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

In cryptanalysis and computer security, password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system in scrambled form. A common approach ([brute-force attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password.

This is a curated list of awesome tools, research, papers and other projects related to password cracking and password security by [@n0kovo@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@n0kovo/?l).
